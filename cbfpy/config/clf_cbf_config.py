# CLF-CBF Configuration class

## Defining the problem:

As with the CBF, we require implementation of the dynamics functions `f` and `g`, as well as the barrier function(s) 
`h`. Now, with the CLF-CBF, we require the definition of the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) `V`. This CLF must be a
positive definite function of the state. 

Depending on the relative degree of your barrier function(s), you should implement the `h_1` method 
(for a relative-degree-1 barrier), and/or the `h_2` method (for a relative-degree-2 barrier).

Likewise, for the CLF, you should implement the `V_1` method (for a relative-degree-1 CLF), and/or the `V_2` method
(for a relative-degree-2 CLF).

## Tuning the CLF-CBF:

As with the CBF, the CLF-CBF config allows for adjustment of the class-Kappa CBF "gain" functions `alpha` and `alpha_2`.
Additionally, the CLF-CBF config allows for adjustment of the class-Kappa CLF "gain" functions `gamma` and `gamma_2`
(for relative-degree-2 CLFs).

The CLF-CBF config also allows for adjustment of the quadratic control term `H` and the linear control term `F` in the
CLF objective. These can be used to adjust the weightings between inputs, for instance.

## Relaxation:

If the CBF constraints are not necessarily globally feasible, you can enable further relaxation in the CLFCBFConfig. 
However, since the CLF constraint was already relaxed with respect to the CBF constraint, this means that tuning the
relaxation parameters is critical. In general, the penalty on the CBF relaxation should be much higher than the penalty
on the CLF relaxation.

If strict enforcement of the CLF-CBF is desired, your higest-level controller should handle the case where the QP
is infeasible.

    """Control Lyapunov Function / Control Barrier Function (CLF-CBF) configuration class.

    This is an abstract class which requires implementation of the following methods:

    - `f(z)`: The uncontrolled dynamics function
    - `g(z)`: The control affine dynamics function
    - `h_1(z)` and/or `h_2(z)`: The barrier function(s), of relative degree 1 and/or 2
    - `V_1(z)` and/or `V_2(z)`: The Lyapunov function(s), of relative degree 1 and/or 2

    For finer-grained control over the CLF-CBF, the following methods may be updated from their defaults:

    - `alpha(h)`: "Gain" of the CBF
    - `alpha_2(h_2)`: "Gain" of the relative-degree-2 CBFs, if applicable
    - `gamma(v)`: "Gain" of the CLF
    - `gamma_2(v)`: "Gain" of the relative-degree-2 CLFs, if applicable
    - `H(z)`: Quadratic control term in the CLF objective
    - `F(z)`: Linear control term in the CLF objective

        n (int): State dimension
        m (int): Control dimension

        u_max (ArrayLike, optional): Maximum control input, shape (m,). Defaults to None (Unconstrained).
        relax_cbf (bool, optional): Whether to allow for relaxation in the CBF QP. Defaults to True.
        cbf_relaxation_penalty (float, optional): Penalty on the slack variable in the relaxed CBF QP. Defaults to 1e4.
            Note: only applies if relax_cbf is True.
        clf_relaxation_penalty (float): Penalty on the CLF slack variable when enforcing the CBF. Defaults to 1e2
        solver_tol (float, optional): Tolerance for the QP solver. Defaults to 1e-3.
        init_args (tuple, optional): If your barrier function relies on additional arguments other than just the state,
            include an initial seed for these arguments here. This is to help test the output of the barrier function.
            Defaults to ().
